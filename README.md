## Titration Calc

### Usage
Welcome all! I have just made a titration calculator as my first ever computer science project!

I am a chemistry major and thought it would be a useful tool to check my answers. This is a program for weak and strong acids being titrated with strong acids. There are a few things you should know before using it.

- You must insert ALL VALUES as decimals as unfortunately in this version scientific notation is not allowed.
- It is fairly simple, and streamlined, so have all your values plugged in and ready to go before you use it.
